Range finding using ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 and array of individual addressable RBG LED strip

Uses ultrasonic sensor to calculate distance to an object. If the object is within some threshold, program will trigger an array of LED lights. LED lights are fully addressable so any light pattern can be programmed. The idea here is to use the range finder as a "smart" bike light. The light will flash if some object gets too close to the rear.
